first steps of coding


This is a simple game for two players
in which a simple HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript code where used.

/**
* Game description
*/
  
Players can move their heroes to right, left, up and down and even move diagonally:
To move hero, player N1 should use { 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' } keys, and the player N2 can 
do same by using {'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight' };

/**
* All elements of the game.
*/
  
1. Two animated heroes (on left side: player N1, and on the right side: player N2);
2. Cherry, it's a fruit that two players will try to collect points,
3. Bomb, it's an enemy element which will interfere to collect point, if some players will touch it
the hero will explode, and the all points will come to zero again.
4. Portal, it's another enemy element, if some players will touch it
the hero will disappear for some time, and the all points will come to zero again.
5. If difference of points more or equal 3, player with more points can 'eat' other player.
6. Wins player who will reach 5 points first.
